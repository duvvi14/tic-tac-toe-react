# Getting Started with Create React App

I built this project using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Because it’s quick and easy to get a React app running without dealing with complex setup.
 
## How I Run the Project

In the project folder, here’s what I use:

### `npm start`

This kicks off the app in development mode.\
I just open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in my browser to see it.

Whenever I make changes, the page reloads automatically, and if I break something, the console shows errors.

### `npm test`

Runs tests in watch mode, so they rerun every time I change code.\
If I ever need more details, I check [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

This creates a production-ready build of the app in the `build` folder.\
It’s optimized and ready to deploy when I’m happy with it.

Details here: [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

Running 'eject' gives me full control over Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc., but it’s permanent—I can’t “uneject” later.

For most projects, I don’t need this.

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
